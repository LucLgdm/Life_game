# CUDA Roadmap ‚Äì From Basics to Parallel Computing

This roadmap is designed to build a **practical and progressive understanding of CUDA**.  
The objective is to move from simple parallel programming to using the GPU for **simulation, graphics, and data-intensive tasks**.  
Later, this knowledge will connect with **OpenGL interop** for rendering and GPU computing.

---

## üéØ Objectives
- Understand how CUDA organizes **threads, blocks, and grids**.
- Learn about GPU **memory hierarchy** and how to optimize for performance.
- Practice writing simple **kernels** and scaling them.
- Get comfortable with debugging GPU code.
- Lay the groundwork for **GPU rendering, simulations, and physics**.

---

## üõ† Prerequisites
- C++ basics.
- Knowledge of arrays, loops, and functions.
- Basic parallelism concepts (independent tasks, shared resources).
- A working CUDA setup (NVIDIA GPU + CUDA toolkit).

---

## üöÄ Roadmap

### 1. **Hello CUDA**
- Write your first CUDA program.
- Launch a kernel that prints ‚ÄúHello from thread X‚Äù.
- Understand `threadIdx`, `blockIdx`, `blockDim`, and `gridDim`.

---

### 2. **Parallel Vector Operations**
- Implement vector addition (`C = A + B`).
- Compare CPU vs GPU performance.
- Learn about **memory transfer** (`cudaMemcpy`).
- Understand the cost of moving data between CPU and GPU.

---

### 3. **2D Grid & Game of Life on GPU**
- Represent a grid of cells.
- Implement Conway‚Äôs Game of Life using CUDA.
- Use **2D thread blocks** to parallelize updates.
- Optimize memory access with **shared memory**.

---

### 4. **Memory Hierarchy & Optimization**
- Explore **global, shared, local, and constant memory**.
- Learn about **coalesced memory access** (why access patterns matter).
- Use **shared memory tiling** to reduce memory bandwidth usage.
- Measure performance with `nvprof` or Nsight.

---

### 5. **Advanced Kernels & Synchronization**
- Learn about **warp divergence** and how to avoid it.
- Use `__syncthreads()` for synchronization.
- Implement **prefix sum (scan)** or **matrix multiplication**.
- Explore performance trade-offs.

---

### 6. **Mini-Project: GPU Simulation**
- Combine everything into a small project:
  - **Particle system** (physics-based).
  - Or **fluid simulation** (basic Navier-Stokes).
  - Or extend **Game of Life** to massive grids.
- Focus on **real-time performance** and **optimizations**.
