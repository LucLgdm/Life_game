# OpenGL + CUDA Interop Roadmap

This roadmap focuses on **combining CUDA computation with OpenGL rendering**.  
The goal is to leverage the GPU both for **parallel computation** and **real-time visualization**, creating hybrid pipelines for simulations, graphics, and engine development.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Understand how to **share data efficiently** between CUDA and OpenGL.
- Learn to use **CUDA kernels to compute data** and **OpenGL to render it**.
- Prepare for **high-performance simulations**, particle systems, or GPU ray tracing.
- Bridge your knowledge from standalone OpenGL and CUDA to a **real-time hybrid workflow**.

---

## ðŸ›  Prerequisites
- Completed OpenGL and CUDA roadmaps.
- Comfortable with:
  - OpenGL buffers (VBO, VAO, textures)
  - CUDA kernels and memory management
- A GPU supporting CUDA and OpenGL (most modern NVIDIA cards).

---

## ðŸš€ Roadmap

### 1. **CUDA â†’ OpenGL Texture**
- Register an OpenGL texture with CUDA (`cudaGraphicsGLRegisterImage`).
- Map it to CUDA (`cudaGraphicsMapResources`) to write data.
- Unmap it and display in OpenGL.
- **Exercise:** implement Game of Life entirely in CUDA and render as a texture in OpenGL.

---

### 2. **Hybrid Renderer**
- Compute **some parts of the scene in CUDA**, render the rest in OpenGL.
- Experiment with:
  - Particle systems
  - Procedural generation
  - Simple physics simulations
- **Exercise:** CUDA computes vertex positions â†’ OpenGL draws points/quads.

---

### 3. **Advanced GPU Pipelines**
- Stream multiple buffers or textures between CUDA and OpenGL.
- Optimize using multiple streams for **overlapping computation and rendering**.
- Explore real-time techniques:
  - BVH traversal for ray tracing
  - Procedural effects computed in CUDA, displayed in OpenGL
- **Exercise:** build a mini-engine where simulation and rendering are fully GPU-driven.

## âœ… Next Steps
- Start by transferring **simple 2D simulations** from CUDA to OpenGL.
- Gradually add **interaction, zoom, and camera control**.
- Move toward **full hybrid 3D GPU engines** combining physics, rendering, and compute.
