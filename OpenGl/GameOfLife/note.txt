🚀 Step 1 – Rendering Setup

Use modern OpenGL (VBO/VAO + shaders).

Represent the grid as a texture where each cell is: alive = white pixel, dead = black pixel.

Render this texture onto a simple fullscreen quad.
👉 This separates simulation (CPU) from rendering (GPU).

🎮 Step 2 – Basic Controls

Camera navigation:

Zoom (mouse wheel).

Panning (arrow keys or WASD).

Automatic "glider follow": compute its bounding box and center the camera on it.

🧮 Step 3 – Game of Life Simulation

Start with a CPU implementation (2D arrays or a hashset for live cells).

Optimization: use a set of live cell coordinates instead of a massive array → makes it easier to handle an infinite grid.

Later: move to a compute shader or CUDA for performance.

🖌️ Step 4 – Drawing Menu (Pattern Editor)

Integrate ImGui (great for in-OpenGL UI).

Tools you could add:

Brush (add cells).

Eraser (remove cells).

Quick loading of known patterns (glider, pulsar, Gosper gun…).

Mouse-click placement of cells directly on the grid.

🌍 Step 5 – Advanced Features

Infinite scroll: camera can move anywhere with no grid limit.

Spaceship tracking: detect gliders (pattern recognition).

Export/import patterns in .rle (standard Life file format).

🔮 Step 6 – Possible Extensions

Switch simulation to CUDA or compute shader for acceleration.

Add a "3D view": each generation rendered as a layer in time (gliders appear as diagonals in 3D).

Support custom rules (Life-like cellular automata).
